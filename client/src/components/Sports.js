      Sports Massage is a type of massage designed for highly active people who engage in athletics. 
      Engaging in sports is harsh on the body and can often lead to injuries in both the short and 
      long term. Sports Massage enhances performance and prolongs a sports career by helping to 
      prevent injury, reduce pains and swelling in the body, relax the mind, increase flexibility, 
      and dramatically improve recovery rates. Sports Massage is also highly effective in aiding the 
      rapid recovery of an athlete from an injury by encouraging greater kinesthetic awareness and 
      in turn promoting the body's natural immune function.
