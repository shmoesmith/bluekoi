      Reflexology is a type of bodywork that focuses on applying pressure to the specific nerve 
      zones in your feet. Unlike other foot massages that intend to mostly relieve tension in the 
      feet themselves, reflexology is a far more in-depth science that aims to harmonize your entire 
      body. According to reflexology, every part of the human body is mapped into your feet. 
      Reflexology treatments have been found to be highly effective for conditions such as allergies, 
      headaches, and depression.
