      Shiatsu is a Japanese form of massage therapy. The word Shiatsu comes from two Japanese words - "shi" (finger) 
      and "atsu" (pressure). In addition to the direct stimulation of pressure points along the energy pathways of your 
      body, gentle stretching techniques are applied over a wider area of the body to integrate the point work and encourage 
      the flow of Chi (energy) throughout the body. Shiatsu is a meditative healing art that honors the body, 
      mind and spirit.
